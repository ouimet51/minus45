Features
1. Get the trump outta here
   when building this is imporant becaus
   it will make us think of how we can easily add this in to
   all different sections of the site. So we need to build
   it scalable.


Next Steps
1. See how to implement service files in django, maybe we can build all of our
logic 
2.Need to build my own replica of the new data format so I can manipulate
the data as I see fit, it might be best to start using classes?
3. What are some classes that can be used? Maybe each attribute will have it's own class?
4. If we make a class called 'article' what should it return? Probably something that can
be iterated on in a dictionary... the final dictionary we pass along to the template lang is
v-important... then we will need to learn what we are doing with JS?
5. Look in to what celery is.

 Dealing with broken images.

Ideally,your views should not contain anything other than presentation logic.
